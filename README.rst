Installation
============

.. code-block::

    pip3 install DUlib --user

Notes
-----

DUlib assumes that you have installed your desired version (e.g., cpu vs. gpu)
of the `torch <https://pypi.org/project/torch/>`_ package as well as the `torchvision <https://pypi.org/project/torchvision/>`_ package.

Similarly, a modern version of `matplotlib <https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/>`_ is
assumed to have been installed on your system.  Matplotlib is required solely for (optional) display
of a real-time graph while training and for various demos; additionally, a running X server is required.

To upgrade to the newest release of DUlib in the presence of a previously installed one, issue the command::

    pip3 install -U DUlib --user

DUlib's documentation is read via a retooling of pydoc3 that includes custom highlighting. Issue the
following command to check that your terminal accepts escape sequences compatible with DUlib's syntax
highlighting and, if necessary, read notes on troubleshooting::

    pd du.highlight

If all is well, read introductory usage remarks with the command::

    pd du

See the `upstream repo <https://github.com/sj-simmons/DUlib>`_ for detailed installation and trouble-shooting
notes as well as release information.
