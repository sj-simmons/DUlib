DUlib
=====

Machine and deep learning tools.

Installation
------------

.. code-block::

    pip3 install DUlib

Notes
-----

* DUlib assumes that you have installed your desired version (e.g., cpu vs. gpu) of
  the `torch <https://pypi.org/project/torch/>`_ package.

* Similarly, a modern version of `matplotlib <https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/>`_ is
  assumed to have been installed on your system.  Matplotlib is required solely for (optional) display,
  while training, of a real-time graph (which requires, additionally, a running X server).

* To upgrade to the newest release of DUlib in the presence of a previously installed one, issue the
  command: ``pip3 install -U DUlib``

* See the `upstream repo <https://github.com/sj-simmons/DUlib>`_ for release/usage notes.
